# Code Your Cloud: Choose Your Own Adventure

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an IT infrastructure management process that applies best practices from DevOps to the provisioning of cloud infrastructure resources. The core idea is to model infrastructure with code, allowing seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines. By maintaining this code in a Git repository and using pull request workflows, the software development process becomes streamlined, and cloud system administration complexity is reduced.

**GitOps**: Using the same approach for managing infrastructure configuration files as for software code enables teams to collaborate more effectively on infrastructure changes and vet configuration files with the same rigor as software code. Popular open-source GitOps tools that work with Kubernetes include Flux and ArgoCD, but these are topics for another discussion.

### Why is IAC So Important? üöÄ

#### Avoid Environment Drift

IaC evolved to solve the problem of ‚Äúenvironment drift.‚Äù Cloud applications usually have separate deployment environments for each stage of their release lifecycle. It‚Äôs common to have development, staging, and production environments composed of networked resources like application servers, load balancers, and databases. Environment drift occurs when these environments fall out of sync.

Without IaC, infrastructure management can be disorganized and fragile:

- System administrators manually connect to remote cloud providers and use APIs or web dashboards to provision new hardware and resources.
- This manual workflow does not provide a holistic view of the application infrastructure.
- Administrators may make changes to one environment and forget to apply them to others, causing environment drift.

Environment drift leads to:

- **Expensive business waste**: Bugs and failures occur because teams build against staging or development environments and find upon deployment that the production environment is out of sync.
- **Time-consuming investigations**: Teams need to determine what is missing and why, leading to delays.

#### The Transition to the Cloud

The ongoing transition to the cloud is a significant trend, with more companies shifting workloads from on-premises infrastructure to cloud environments. These cloud environments can be managed via APIs, making them suitable for IaC tools.

#### Frequent Infrastructure Changes

The rate of infrastructure changes is increasing due to:

1. **Cloud adoption and modernization**.
2. **Organizations leveraging cloud elasticity** to move faster.

For teams managing:

- **Tens or hundreds of cloud resources** changing every few months: Managing infrastructure using scripts or interactive means (UI/CLI) might still be feasible.
- **Thousands or tens of thousands of resources** changing daily or hourly: Automation via IaC is essential to manage complexity.

### Benefits üéâ

IaC tames the complexity of cloud infrastructure by using the same software engineering principles, approaches, and tools that have enabled other software-based systems to scale. Key benefits include:

1. **Repeatability and Consistency**: Infrastructure defined via IaC can be deployed repeatedly. Need a high-fidelity development environment copy of the production environment? Or consistent infrastructure across regions? IaC makes this easy.
2. **Version Control**: By storing infrastructure configurations in version control systems like Git, you can:
   - Track changes over time
   - Roll back to previous versions
   - Collaborate effectively with team members
3. **Better Alignment and Collaboration**: IaC enables infrastructure and software development teams to adopt DevOps principles and work closely together. Shared language and practices foster cross-team collaboration, fundamental to DevOps.
4. **Cost Management**: Automating resource provisioning and de-provisioning helps optimize usage and control costs by allocating and releasing resources based on actual needs.
5. **Reduced Risk and Improved Security**: IaC ensures consistent application of security policies and best practices. Automated provisioning reduces human error.
6. **Documentation and Transparency**: Infrastructure as code serves as always-up-to-date documentation, providing clear and transparent insight into configuration and management.

### How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Integration with Your Cloud Provider**: IaC tools integrate with cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.) to manage infrastructure resources.
2. **Writing Source Code**: Model your desired infrastructure using:
   - Standard modeling languages like JSON, YAML
   - Tool-specific languages like HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for Terraform
   - General-purpose programming languages for greater flexibility and customization
3. **Storage in Git Repository**: Store the source code files describing your infrastructure in a Git repository for version control, team collaboration, and CI/CD integration.
4. **Generation of Execution Plan**: The IaC tool analyzes your source code and generates an execution plan, outlining changes needed to achieve the desired state.
5. **Application of Plan**: Review and approve the execution plan, then the IaC tool applies the changes to your infrastructure (creating, modifying, or deleting resources).
6. **Continuous Management**: After applying changes, the IaC tool continues managing your infrastructure to ensure it remains in the desired state, detecting and correcting deviations, scaling automatically, and managing configurations.

### Important Concepts üîë

#### Immutability and Idempotency

IaC tools adhere to a philosophy of immutability:

- Instead of making direct changes to existing resources, generate a new infrastructure state reflecting desired changes and apply that configuration.
- This ensures predictable and consistent infrastructure states, making differences (diff) between current and desired states clear and interpretable.

**Idempotency**: An operation can be performed any number of times and always produces the same result, ensuring the system's state is consistent.

#### Rollback Capabilities

IaC makes rolling back to a previous state easier in case of errors or issues during updates, ensuring quick recovery to a known functional state, reducing downtime, and minimizing impact.

#### Enhanced Stability and Predictability

Immutable Infrastructure maintains consistent configurations throughout the application or service lifecycle, reducing unexpected issues due to configuration drift.

#### Dependency Resolution

Immutability simplifies resource management and dependency resolution:

- IaC tools automatically identify resources and dependencies.
- This eliminates manual dependency tracking and resource ordering, simplifying complex infrastructure management.

### Choose Your Adventure üåü

Terraform, Pulumi, and AWS CDK are all categorized as IaC solutions, playing a vital role in overseeing IT infrastructure using software-defined guidelines. These tools enable development and operation teams to create, modify, and set up computing resources securely, uniformly, and automatically.

#### Terraform: A Tool for IaC

Terraform, an open-source IaC tool from HashiCorp, allows you to describe infrastructure using configuration files written in:
